          I am a full stack developer with over 3 years of experience of building scalable applications. { } <br /><br />
          I used my spare time exploring some new tech tools to improve my skills and I enjoy solving problems. Being a developer is very challenging, so the best way to cope up with this is to take a break and do some stuff like walk, take a snack and play video games.
          I love to read manga and manhwa in my past time and like to create one, but I don't have the proper tools and skills. ðŸ˜‚
